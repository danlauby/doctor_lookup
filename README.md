#### By Dan Lauby

## Description

This program allows users to enter a medical issue and receive a list of possible doctors that can treat that specific medical issue.

## Planning

1. Configuration/dependencies
  * NPM (Development)
    * bower-files (pulls in dynamic list of file paths to bower components)
    * browser-sync (live CSS Reload & Browser Syncing)
    * browserify (recursively analyze all the require() calls)
    * del (delete files and folders)
    * gulp (task manager)
    * gulp-concat (concatenates files into one)
    * gulp-jshint (Checks for JavaScript syntax errors)
    * gulp-sass (plugin allows use of SASS)
    * gulp-sourcemaps (gives ability to pipe files through multiple operations)
    * gulp-uglify (Removes white space and creates shorter variable names)
    * gulp-util (utility functions for gulp plugins)
    * jshint (Checks for JavaScript syntax errors)
    * vinyl-source-stream (converts the readable stream from browserify into a vinyl stream)
  * bower (Production)
    * jQuery
    * Bootstrap
